# Enhanced Audio Log Experience

## About
This is an enhanced version of the already existent audio library with the addition of possible **real-time delivery of references** (imgs, hyperlinks, short descriptions) relating to timestamps in a specific audio file. We will be primarily focusing on the additions of such files and data into the database of the website application and how we would query them and present them to end-users.
* Implement additions to an already existent database 
* Have reference files (imgs, hyperlinks, text) that appear on timestamps for users
* Support for admin accounts/audio files owners to add/modify reference files
